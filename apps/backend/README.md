## Building & Running

This project is managed by Nx. To run the API backend, execute the following command:

```bash
npx nx run backend:run
```

Find more commands to run by inspecting the project in the Nx graph by running:

```bash
npx nx graph
```

## Databases

This app uses a database to store its data on. Currently, we support the following databases:

| Type    | Default |
|---------|---------|
| MySQl   |         |
| MariaDB |         |
| H2      | âœ…       |

Interaction with the databases and definitions for the tables are handled via [Expose](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/exposed/get-started-with-exposed.html), see their documentation for more info on how to work with schema's, transactions, etc.

### Environment variables

Modify the [Environment file](./.env) to determine which database to use when running the app locally, or in a Docker container. The `DB_TYPE` should be set to determine which type of database to use. If no valid argument is provided, the default database type (`h2`) will be used. This database will default to be in-memory.

Don't forget to set the corresponding environment variables for your database! If you use a MySQL database for example, you'll need to set the environment variables prefixed with `MYSQL_` in order for the app to properly connect to your database instance.

### Environments

For production, remote test and development environments we use `MariaDB` as the database type. For unit testing, an in-memory `H2` database will be used. For details on how to connect to those databases (other than the production environment obviously), please contact one of the code owners.
